Hyperion Control is an addon for Kodi Mediacenter that observes Kodi events (playing state, screensaver, ...). Based on these events you can control Hyperion components to enable or disable accordingly.

For example playing a video should enable screen capture, if you pause the video or you are at the Kodi menu the screen capture should be disabled to show a background effect as mood light
